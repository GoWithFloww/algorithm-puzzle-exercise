# Algorithm Puzzle Exercises

This repository contains solutions to data structure and algorithm puzzles, following the exercises and patterns presented in the book [*Coding Interview Patterns: Nail Your Next Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Interview-Patterns-Nail-Your/dp/1736049135).

The code is organized based on the patterns discussed in the book, with each pattern residing in its own subfolder within the `src` directory.

Each puzzle is implemented in both:

*   TypeScript (`src/<pattern>/*.ts`)
*   Go (`src/<pattern>/*.go`)

Comprehensive unit tests are included for both implementations to ensure correctness.
